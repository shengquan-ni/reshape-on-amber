The Bureau of Public Health (BOG) has made it known that it requires external confirmation of these results. This stance has dismayed AZP Lab director John Codrington, who stated that it shows a lack of confidence in local authority.<br><br>The BOG has made it clear why they have come to this decision. They will conduct further tests through the CARPHA [Caribbean Public Health Agency] because this is the 1st possible instance of the virus locally; the virus is similar in presentation to other ailments such as dengue fever and chikungunya, also known as Chik-V; and the positive test cases may have brought it back from foreign travels.<br><br>The call for further study will not disrupt any preventative measures as doctors have been armed with the necessary information that the public requires regarding the nature and procedures surrounding the virus. Its similarity to dengue and Chik-V means that a similar approach to prevention is required.<br><br>People need to ensure that their homes and communities are free of mosquito-friendly breeding grounds. As with the chikungunya virus, there is no vaccine or preventive drug for Zik-V, and only treatment of symptoms is possible. Usually non-steroid anti-inflammatories and/or non-salicylic analgesics are used.<br><br>While there is no cure or vaccine for the virus, health officials urge people to reduce the risk of contracting Zika virus infection by using the following measures:<br><br>Use anti-mosquito devices (insecticide-treated bed nets, coils, smudge pots, spray, repellents) and wearing long sleeves and clothes with long legs, especially during the hours of highest mosquito activity (morning and late afternoon).<br><br>Mosquito repellent based on a 30 per cent DEET concentration is recommended -- for newborn children under 3 months, repellents are not recommended; instead, insecticide-treated bed nets should be used.<br><br>Before using repellents, pregnant women and children under the age of 12 years should consult a physician or pharmacist.<br><br>Unlike Chik-V, Zik-V can also be transmitted through sexual contact.<br><br>[byline: Jonathan Stuart]<br><br>--<br>communicated by<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[It would not be surprising if Zika virus has arrived in Suriname, since 2 other countries in northern South America -- adjacent Brazil and somewhat more distant Colombia -- have reported ongoing cases. The report does not indicate if these 2 cases are locally acquired or are imported cases of Zika virus infection. Sending samples to an outside international reference laboratory is prudent in situations when a new pathogen appears. The AZP laboratory should welcome confirmation of their test results.<br><br>A map showing the location of Suriname in north eastern South America can be accessed at <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/37</a>. - Mod.TY]<br><br>******<br>[2] Cape Verde<br>Date: Mon 2 Nov 2015<br>Source: Voice of America [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY, edited]<br><a href="http://www.voaportugues.com/content/virus-de-zika-confirmado-em-cabo-verde/3033052.html">http://www.voaportugues.com/content/virus-de-zika-confirmado-em-cabo-verde/3033052.html</a><br><br><br>The Cape Verde minister of health today [2 Nov 2015] confirmed the occurrence of a Zika virus outbreak, adding that since September [2015] there were nearly 1000 patients with this disease, which is transmitted the same way that dengue [viruses] are. The minister of health, Cristina Fontes Lima, and the director general of health, Tomas Valdez, confirmed the disease after tests of blood samples sent in October [2015] to the Institut Pasteur in Dakar were positive. Of the 64 samples, 17 were positive, according to Cristina Fontes Lima, who stated also that the tests ruled out dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, measles, and rubella, among other diseases.<br><br>Tomas Valdez stated that "up until yesterday [1 Nov 2015], since September [2015] approximately 1000 cases with symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection were attended in the Agostinho Neto Hospital and the Praia Health Centers [Praia county]. Among the symptoms were red spots on the face, trunk and arms with strong itching, headache and low-grade fever."<br><br>On average, the health services have attended 50-60 cases per day from this infection, having created a line for attention at the urgent care unit in the Agostinho Neto Hospital.<br><br>Tomas Valdez explained that the infection has a benign course of around 7 days and does not present with complications that require hospitalization. He added that there is no vaccine, so treatment is symptomatic with paracetamol, and said that up to now the cases have been registered "essentially in Praia city".<br><br>Zika virus is [relatively] new and the 1st transmission between humans was [reported] in the 1950s in Nigeria. In order to avoid infection, the authorities recommend elimination of catchments of stagnant water [in which the vector mosquitoes breed] and use of protection against mosquito bites.<br><br>The director general of health added, however, that it is still not possible to relate this outbreak to the epidemic of the same virus currently going on in Brazil.<br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>GPHIN Alert <br>&lt;GPHIN-ALERT@opentext.com&gt;<br><br>[This is a substantial outbreak of Zika virus. Although the reference laboratory confirmed several of the infections as due to Zika virus (17 of 64 samples tested), one wonders if the 47 negative samples were not taken at the point in time that would permit diagnosis or if the febrile patients were infected with a different pathogen. One hopes that the Cape Verde Zika virus has been (or will be) isolated for genetic comparison with sequences from the outbreak in Brazil and the recent outbreaks in some of the Pacific Islands.<br><br>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Cape Verde can be accessed at <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15</a>. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
