From my point of view (and of several colleagues) we are not talking about a teratogenic issue. What I do believe is that we have a normal formation of the brain and after that the Zika [virus] (or other unknown factor) infects and destroys the brain tissue. We can see that because of the lack of damage of brainstem and the cerebellum (the last in most of the cases). So the infection is not in the 1st trimester but later in pregnancy. The images are really very impressive. Unfortunately I cannot share [them] at this point (because they are not from my patients and I received them for educational purposes) but I do believe that a couple of publications will be released soon and this will clarify a lot of the questions.<br><br>Also ZIKA was found in a couple of fetal tissue samples by the Evandro Chagas Institute and FIOCRUZ.

The authors were not clear on whether viral culture was attempted or whether antibody studies were conducted on the mothers. There is no real time frame for when the mothers were infected beyond a comment that they had relevant symptoms. The authors also do not describe investigations for any other infectious agents or environmental factors nor anything about the deliveries.<br><br>Investigation #1...<br>Foetal ultrasound was conducted at 30.1 weeks' gestation and revealed anomalies including:<br>- unusually small head circumference<br>- low weight<br>- brain atrophy<br>- coarse calcifications of the frontal lobe<br><br>Investigation #2...<br>Foetal ultrasound 29.2 weeks' gestation and revealed anomalies including:<br>- unusually small head circumference<br>- low weight<br>- a range of brain anomalies<br>- some calcifications<br>- cataracts in both eyes and 1 eye was smaller than the other<br><br>Around the same time in the same State (Paraiba)....<br>- 6 children borne with small head circumference were diagnosed with ZIKV (lab confirmed?) and born (without complication?) to mothers reporting symptoms during pregnancy<br><br>The authors noted that the lack of cases of vertical ZIKV transmission found in over 65 preceding years may be because cases have not been sought, not been reported or were just rare until now. This lack of data may also relate to levels of local immunity which may act to moderate ZIKV infection among people in areas of endemic transmission, or perhaps because the virus has changed and this is a new trick it has acquired because of mutation. In short, we don't know if microcephaly and central nervous system developmental interference is a new or an old-but-unknown feature of Zika virus disease (ZVD). Or if it is even related to ZIKV at all.<br><br>The authors conclude by warning that if investigations in other states of Brazil find people with ZIKV antibodies, that this is a severe health threat. However they make no mention of the importance of seeking other culprits -- likely or not -- in the search for understanding of why cases of microcephaly in Brazil have risen so rapidly. Differential diagnosis can be a complex beast in the mosquito-borne virus world.<br><br>In a 1 Dec [2015] Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological alert,[3] data up to 30 Nov 2015 listed 1248 cases of microcephaly (99.7 / 100 000 live births), including 7 deaths, in 14 states of Brazil. By comparison, in 2000, the prevalence was 5.5 cases / 100 000 live births and 5.7 cases / 100 000 live births in 2010.[3] <br><br>More recently the Brazil Ministry of Health tabulated all microcephaly cases. From an average of 156 cases in each of the preceding 5 years, the number has jumped to 3174 cases in 2015. <br><br>Both data sets describe a 20-fold increase in cases in just a year.[4]<br><br>Whether ZIKV is to blame, or something else, the urgency with which this outbreak of microcephaly is now being investigated in Brazil is clearly warranted. <br><br>References:<br>1.

There is no indication that the GBS patients have been shown to have been infected by the virus.
