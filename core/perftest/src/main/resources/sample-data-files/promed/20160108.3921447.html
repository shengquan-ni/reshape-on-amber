Pernambuco has reported the most cases at 1185. (<a href="http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201601/132166-brasil-bebes-infancia-virus-zika.html">http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201601/132166-brasil-bebes-infancia-virus-zika.html</a> in Spanish)<br><br>In a report of 6 Jan 2015, the director of the Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance of the Ministry of Health, Claudio Maierovitch said that the ministry should analyze the data on Zika virus infections collected in so-called sentinel laboratories and, thereafter, adopt a decision on the format for a formal Notification of the disease. Maierovitch wants to increase the number of collection areas, so that this sample is even greater. He said it was "tempting" to adopt a mandatory reporting format, where all suspected cases are reported, since the presence of the virus is proven in the region. This is the model used, for example, dengue and chikungunya, diseases transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ which also transmits Zika virus. "But in the case of Zika, where 80 percent of cases are asymptomatic and complaints from patients can be confused with other diseases, such an assessment may be questionable. The impression is that we can always just be seeing the tip of the iceberg," he added. (<a href="http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/noticias/notificac-o-federal-de-zika-deve-mudar-1.370871">http://www.hojeemdia.com.br/noticias/notificac-o-federal-de-zika-deve-mudar-1.370871</a> [in Portuguese]<br><br>Dr. Charles Calisher (&lt;calisher@cybersafe.net&gt;) reminded us that flaviviruses can persist in tissues decades after the acute phase of infection.  He noted that, "Mikhail Petrovich Chumakov, the great Russian virologist, acquired tick borne encephalitis (TBE) virus infection in Siberia and was seriously ill (and then partially paralyzed, nearly blind, bilaterally deaf, and more) but not worse until his death [more than 5 decades later] in 1993.  At his request, his body was autopsied and TBE viral RNA was found in his brain tissue." <br><br>Dr. David M. Morens, MD, (&lt;DMORENS@niaid.nih.gov&gt; an epidemiologist with the US Public Health Service and advisor to the US NIH commented:<br> <br>"One thing that a recent paper and the literature does not address is the following:<br> <br>For those babies with microcephaly born to mothers who had a proven or clinically consistent episode of a dengue-like/Zika-like disease, what was the DATE of the illness with respect to the stage of gestation at that time?<br> <br>One would expect, based on other teratogenic diseases, that the time of the mother's illness would correspond to a fairly narrow window of time in embryogenesis, probably within the 1st trimester and possibly a narrower time of maybe around 12 weeks plus or minus.  An embryologist could be more specific about the time of arrest of brain development that results in the type/extent of microcephaly seen. <br> <br>For every baby born/aborted with microcephaly, the time of probable conception (and therefore gestational age at all time points after that) can usually be estimated by a pediatrician to within a couple weeks over the 9 or so month interval of gestation. For those mothers who had a recognized illness, which will not be all mothers but will be many, and in which a date of illness is remembered or recorded, it is thereby possible to figure out, with a small margin of error, when in gestation the infection occurred.  If it is all over the map within the 9 months of prergnancy, then that would be inconsistent with a Zika infection being the cause, I would think, unless Zika causes chronic infection of fetal tissue.  <br> <br>That is not impossible; babies exposed to rubela, CMV, and other viruses in utero at a particular stage become tolerant and treat the virus as self immunologically, and immunologically compromised people and primates had WNV in their nervous systems for months, that was when they did human infections way back decades ago. <br><br>In this regard, in addition to looking for Zika [virus or RNA] in fetal/newborn tissue and placenta, it would be important to get cord blood and blood from the babies to look for, among other things, the immune responses."<br><br>ProMED thanks Drs.

During his return he suffered flu-like symptoms including odynophagia, anorexia, and myalgia. On the 16 Dec [2015], he attended a hospital in Santiago, Chile, with fever up to 40 C, maculopapular rash involving trunk and extremities, painful cervical and retroauricular lymphadenopathy, mild conjunctivitis, and myalgia. Laboratory exams were unremarkable except elevated C-reactive protein levels of 21.6 mg/dL (normal 0-5). 1 day later, further blood samples were taken. Dengue IgM and IgG as well as NS1 antigen were negative by rapid diagnostic test and chikungunya virus IgM was negative by indirect immunofluorescence. Malaria was excluded by rapid diagnostic test and thick and thin blood films. A molecular panel including malaria, dengue, and chikungunya was negative. Samples were sent to the Instituto de Salud Publica (ISP) in Santiago, where Zika virus nucleic acids were detected by PCR. <br><br>The patient recovered rapidly and without complications. During his travel, he had not used insect repellents and noted several mosquito bites. He had travelled together with 2 friends, 1 of whom had identical symptoms with fever and rash, but had not attended a hospital. <br><br>Autochthonous Zika virus infection has been reported from Easter Island (Chile) in March 2015 (see ProMED-mail  <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open('../post/20140309.2322907');">20140309.2322907</a> and Tognarelli et al. Arch Virol 2015 Nov 26 Epub ahead of print). Our case represents the 1st ZIKV case in continental Chile and the 1st imported case. The fact that 2 of the 3 travelers to Colombia presumably suffered from the same infection indicates a high infection risk and since the travelers visited typical touristic regions in Colombia, further cases in returning travelers can be expected. Molecular detection by PCR, if available, is a valid diagnostic tool for acute cases (day 1-5 of fever onset) and should be performed in febrile travelers returning from endemic countries if dengue and chikungunya diagnosis are negative (see: <a href="http://www.paho.org/Hq/index.php?option=com_topics&amp;view=article&amp;id=427&amp;Itemid=41484&amp;lang=en">http://www.paho.org/Hq/index.php?option=com_topics&amp;view=article&amp;id=427&amp;Itemid=41484&amp;lang=en</a>).   <br><br>The infection is self-limiting and usually mild, but the recent report of a possible association of ZIKV and congenital defects (microcephaly) in Brazil raises great concerns. All travelers to the affected regions should avoid daytime exposure to mosquitos. For pregnant travelers, most international institutions recommend strict anti-mosquito precautions, but in our opinion, pregnant women might consider changing their travel itinerary until further information on the possible potential of ZIKV to cause congenital damage is available.<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>Thomas Weitzel <br>Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile<br>&lt;thomas.weitzel@gmail.com&gt;<br><br>Claudia Cortes <br>Clinica Santa Maria, Santiago, Chile<br><br>Jorge Perez <br>Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile<br><br>[This report illustrates the movement of a traveler infected with a virus, Zika in this case, who returns from an endemic area and arrives in a locality where the virus is not present. The travel history of the patient provided essential information necessary for establishing diagnostic rule-outs and the supporting tests necessary to make a diagnosis of he illness. Mainland Chile has not had dengue or chikungunya outbreaks, so ongoing transmission of Zika virus is very unlikely in this instance.  <br><br>A map of South America showing the location of Colombia and Chile can be accessed at <a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/sa.htm">http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/sa.htm</a>. - Mod.TY]<br><br>******<br>[3] France ex Martinique<br>Date: Tue 5 Jan 2016<br>From: Prof. Denis Malvy &lt;denis.malvy@chu-bordeaux.fr&gt; and Dr. Alexandre Duvignaud [edited]<br><br>A healthy 60-year-old French man was referred to our department on 29 Dec 2015 for a dengue-like syndrome. He was just returning from Martinique, a French overseas territory situated in the Caribbean, where he spent holidays 10-25 Dec [2015]. He stayed mainly in Le Robert, on the eastern Atlantic coast, and had brief daily trips to Le Diamant, Trois Ilets and Sainte-Marie. He also frequented Le Lamentin international airport at both the beginning and the end of his journey. The patient reported multiple mosquito bites, especially while staying at his holiday residence. He did not use any insect repellents.<br><br>On 22 Dec [2015], the patient experienced fever, malaise, retro-orbital headaches, transient conjunctivitis, sore throat, myalgia and arthralgia, involving symmetrically metacarpophalangeal joints, wrists, elbows and knees. He received self-treatment by acetaminophen. Then all the symptoms improved in a few days. On 29 Dec [2015], he acknowledged persisting myalgia and arthralgia as well as a discrete maculopapular rash (on a dark skin) with pruritus involving the dorsal faces of hands and forearms as well as the pectoral and periumbilical regions. Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable and in particular no arthritis was noticed. Then, 2 days later the rash was vanishing, the pruritus had stopped and he was just exhausted.<br><br>Laboratory investigations performed on 29 Dec [2015], i.e. 7 days after disease onset, revealed normal C-reactive protein, an increase of creatine phosphokinase at 837 U/L (normal if less than 171 U/L) which could be considered as physiologic in this Afro-Caribbean man, a slight increase of lactate-dehydrogenase at 302 U/L (normal if under 248 U/L), normal liver test and renal function. Blood cytology revealed a discrete lymphopenia at 1.16 G/L (normal values 1.5 - 4 G/L). The platelet count was normal.<br><br>Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Zika virus was positive on plasma and urine whereas RT-PCR on plasma for both dengue and chikungunya viruses was negative. <br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>Prof. Denis Malvy<br>Geosentinel Bordeaux Site director<br>Head of Tropical Medicine and Travel Clinics<br>Bordeaux University Hospital <br>&lt;denis.malvy@chu-bordeaux.fr&gt;<br><br>Dr. Alexandre Duvignaud<br>Geosentinel Bordeaux Site deputy director<br>Tropical Medicine and Travel Clinics<br>Bordeaux University Hospital <br><br>[ProMED thanks Prof. Malvy and Dr. Duvignaud for this case history.
