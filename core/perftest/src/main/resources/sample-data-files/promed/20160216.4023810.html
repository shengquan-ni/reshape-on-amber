The discovery suggests microcephaly is not necessarily a new phenomenon and questions whether Zika virus is even the cause. Zika virus has been occupying the global media for weeks now, prompted by what appears to be a huge spike in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads.<br><br>The scramble in Brazil to discover the cause led paediatric cardiologist Dr Sandra Mattos to realise she was sitting on a database which could provide some answers. Over 4 years, she and her colleagues surveyed more than 100 000 newborns for congenital heart disease in the Brazilian state of Paraiba. But, importantly, in just over 16 000 of these babies, the nurses also collected other information, such as length, weight, and head circumference -- the indictor for microcephaly. "We tried to establish the pattern of microcephaly over the last 4 years," Dr Mattos said.<br><br>Dr Mattos and her colleagues were surprised by the numbers. "What we expected was that we would have something like 3-4 cases a year of microcephaly; that is what has been documented in the official sites. But we then noticed that we had much, much higher numbers." As part of the survey, Dr Mattos' team assessed head size in 3 ways to ensure it was as accurate as possible. "Independent of what criteria we used, we had between 2-8 per cent of babies that would fall into the criteria of microcephaly," she said. This represents between 2000 and 4000 babies per year in the state of Paraiba, about 1000 times more than the team expected.<br><br>The survey goes back to 2012 and 2013 and shows a spike each spring and summer, and while the headlines are all recent, the biggest peak in north eastern Brazil was actually in 2014. But Dr Mattos said there was something different and potentially very worrying about the 2015 spring-summer spike in microcephaly, relating to how small the babies' heads were. "In the most severe cases of microcephaly, that group which are the very severe cases, they are definitely increasing from the last part of 2015," she said.<br><br>International publicity about microcephaly has focused on babies with small heads, but it is unusual for microcephaly to present by itself. It is usually part of a syndrome where there are heart defects, limb defects or other congenital defects. Dr Mattos said these cases of microcephaly were not coupled with a rise in heart defects in the same babies. "That's what's really unusual about this outbreak," she said. "Most of the microcephaly cases that are being reported now are primarily very severe microcephaly without anything else."<br><br>The survey calls into question whether these microcephaly cases are caused by Zika virus or something else. If it is Zika virus, it has been in Brazil for a lot longer than people have thought, but that does not explain why after 50 years Zika has only now been linked to microcephaly.<br><br>[byline: Norman Swan]<br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br>and<br>Roland Hubner<br>Superior Health Council<br>Brussels<br>Belgium<br>&lt;roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be&gt;<br><br>[The debate over the role of Zika virus infections in incidence of microcephaly will likely continue for some time.

Our discussion includes details of fetal imaging and pathological and virologic analyses.<br><br>"In mid-October 2015, a 25-year-old previously healthy European woman came to the Department of Perinatology at the University Medical Center in Ljubljana, Slovenia because of assumed fetal anomalies. Since December 2013, she had lived and worked as a volunteer in Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte state. She had become pregnant at the end of February 2015. During the 13th week of gestation, she had become ill with high fever, which was followed by severe musculoskeletal and retroocular pain and an itching, generalized maculopapular rash. Since there was a ZIKV epidemic in the community, infection with the virus was suspected, but no virologic diagnostic testing was performed. Ultrasonography that was performed at 14 and 20 weeks of gestation showed normal fetal growth and anatomy.<br><br>"The patient returned to Europe at 28 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonography that was performed at 32 weeks of gestation confirmed intrauterine growth retardation (estimated 3rd percentile of fetal weight) with normal amniotic fluid, a placenta measuring 3.5 cm in thickness (normal size) with numerous calcifications, a head circumference below the 2nd percentile for gestation (microcephaly), moderate ventriculomegaly, and a transcerebellar diameter below the 2nd percentile. Brain structures were blurred, and there were numerous calcifications in various parts of the brain.<br><br>"Medical termination of the pregnancy was performed at 32 weeks of gestation.

In addition, all autopsy samples were tested on PCR assay and were found to be negative for other flaviviruses (dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus), along with chikungunya virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, enteroviruses, and _Toxoplasma gondii_.<br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>Roland Hubner<br>Superior Health Council<br>Brussels<br>Belgium<br>&lt;roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be&gt;<br><br>[This case provides additional evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus, with teratogenic effects. The case for vertical maternal-fetal transmission would have been a bit stronger, and the timeline clearer, had the woman's Zika virus infection been confirmed in Brazil. However, since Zika virus transmission was going on at the time she was in Brazil, and since there is no Zika virus transmission going on in Slovenia, she must have been infected at some time while she was in Brazil. - Mod.TY]<br><br>******<br>[3] Ocular effects<br>Date: Tue 9 Feb 2016<br>Source: JAMA Opthalmology published online doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0267 [summ. &amp; edited]<br><a href="http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2491896&amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;utm_content=jamaophthalmol.2016.0267">http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2491896&amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;utm_content=jamaophthalmol.2016.0267</a><br><br><br>Bruno de Paula Freitas, Joao Rafael de Oliveira Dias, Juliana Prazeres, Gielson Almeida Sacramento, Albert Icksang Ko, Maurcio Maia, et al.

On average, Colombia registers 242 GBS cases per year or approximately 19 cases per month or 5 cases per week. The 86 GBS cases reported in those 5 weeks is 3 times higher than the averaged expected cases of the 6 previous years.<br><br>Initial reports indicated that all the 86 reported GBS cases presented with symptoms compatible with a Zika virus infection.

While cases were recorded in the majority of the federal territories of the country, 66 were detected in the state of Zulia, mainly in the Maracaibo municipality.<br><br>Preliminary analysis of the GBS cases in the state of Zulia indicates that the 66 cases originated from 6 municipalities. Of the 66 cases, 30 per cent were 45-54 years old and 29 per cent were 65 years or older; 61 per cent were male and 39 per cent were female.
