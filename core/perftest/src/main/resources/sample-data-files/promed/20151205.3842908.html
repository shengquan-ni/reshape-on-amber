In addition, between January and July 2015, 121 cases with neurological symptoms or with Guillain-Barre were reported by states in the northeastern part of Brazil.<br><br>In October 2015, the Ministry of Health of Brazil reported an unusual increase in cases of microcephaly in the state of Pernambuco and at a lower level in other north-eastern states. On 17 Nov 2015, the Ministry of Health of Brazil confirmed in an international health regulation (IHR) message the molecular identification of ZIKV in amniotic fluid samples collected from 2 pregnant women in Paraiba state whose foetuses had been confirmed with microcephaly by ultrasound examinations.<br><br>On 17 Nov 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert regarding an increase in microcephaly in the north-east of Brazil. In response to the situation, Brazil's Ministry of Health had declared a national public health emergency on 11 Nov 2015. As of 28 Nov 2015, 1248 suspected cases of microcephaly have been identified in 311 municipalities across 14 states of Brazil. Pernambuco state has reported the highest number of cases (646) followed by the states of Paraiba (248), Rio Grande do Norte (79), Sergipe (77), Alagoas (59), Bahia (37), Piaui (36), Ceara (25), Rio de Janeiro (13), Maranhao (12), Tocantins (12), Goias (2), Distrito Federal (1) and Mato Grosso do Sul (1). Among these cases, 7 deaths were reported, and 5 additional deaths in Rio Grande do Norte and Piaui are currently being investigated.<br><br>As of 1 Dec 2015, according to media quoting the Ministry of Health, 28 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) had been reported in Sergipe state. Last week, according to media, 7 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) were linked to ZIKV infections in Pernambuco state.<br><br>On 25 Nov 2015, according to media quoting the Flavivirus Laboratory at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, 7 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) had been linked to ZIKV infections in Pernambuco state. The number of cases of GBS grew significantly in the north-east of the country between April and June 2015, shortly after the ZIKV epidemic started. In Rio Grande do Norte, there have been 24 cases of GBS, 4 times more than the historical average. In Pernambuco state, 130 cases have been reported, which is a significant increase on the most recent reports. There have also been increases in the states of Maranhao (14 cases) and Paraiba (6 cases). Investigations are ongoing regarding a possible association with ZIKV infection. <br><br>Chile (Easter Island)<br>According to WHO-PAHO, autochthonous circulation of ZIKV was reported in Easter Island from February to June 2014.

The cases are reported from pregnancies that occurred during the ZIKV infection outbreak in French Polynesia (September 2013 - March 2014) at a gestational age of less than 6 months. None of the pregnant women described clinical signs of ZIKV infection, but the 4 tested were found positive by IgG serology assays for flavivirus, suggesting a possible asymptomatic ZIKV infection. Further serological investigations are ongoing. Based on the temporal correlation of these cases with the ZIKV epidemic, the health authorities of French Polynesia hypothesise that ZIKV infection may be associated with these abnormalities if mothers are infected during the 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy.<br><br>Other countries<br>Since the beginning of [2015], sporadic autochthonous cases have been reported in Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Zealand (2 imported cases from Samoa).<br><br>Asia<br>Indonesia<br>On 15 Nov 2015, media reported the 1st ZIKV case in the country.

Implications for public health in the Americas<br>-----------<br><br>Given the increase of congenital anomalies, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and other neurological and autoimmune syndromes in areas where Zika virus is circulating and their possible relation to the virus, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends its Member States establish and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm Zika virus cases, prepare healthcare facilities for the possible increase in demand at all healthcare levels and specialized care for neurological syndromes, and to strengthen antenatal care. In addition, Member States should continue efforts to reduce the presence of mosquito vectors through an effective vector control strategy and public communication.<br><br>Transplacental transmission<br>----------<br>On 28 Nov 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health established the relationship between the increase in occurrence of microcephaly and Zika virus infection through the detection of Zika virus genome in the blood and tissue samples of a baby from the state of Para. The newborn presented microcephaly and other congenital anomalies and died within 5 minutes of being born. The confirmation of the presence of the viral genome was provided by the Evandro Chagas Institute, national reference laboratory for arboviruses in Belem, Para. According to the preliminary analysis of the investigation conducted by the Brazil health authorities, the greatest risk of microcephaly or congenital anomalies in newborns is associated with Zika virus infection in the first trimester of pregnancy. <br><br>Zika virus-related deaths <br>----------<br>As of 28 Nov 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health has notified 3 deaths associated with Zika virus infection. The fatal cases are 2 adults and 1 newborn. The 1st fatal case is a male adult with no neurological disorders, with history of lupus erythematosus, chronic use of corticosteroid drugs, rheumatoid arthritis, and alcoholism. He was admitted as a suspected dengue case, however dengue was discarded and the final laboratory diagnosis by RTp-PCR technique was Zika virus infection. Zika virus genome was detected by RT- PCR in the blood and organ samples (brain, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and heart). Additionally, Zika virus was identified through partial sequencing of the virus. <br><br>The 2nd fatal case is a 16-year-old female from the Benevides municipality in the state of Para. She had no neurological disorder, and was admitted to the hospital as a suspected dengue case. The onset of her symptoms (headache, nausea, and petechiae) was on 29 Sep 2015 and she died in late October 2015. Zika virus infection was confirmed by RTp-PCR. The 3rd fatal case is the newborn described above. <br><br>--<br>Comunicated by: <br>ProMED-PORT<br>&lt;promed-port@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[The Zika virus panorama is changing almost daily, both in terms of its geographical distribution in the Americas as well as it pathogenesis.  It is not surprising that the geographic range of the virus is increasing, given the movement of infected, viremic individuals and the presence of abundant mosquito vectors. If the observed cases of microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome are shown conclusively to be caused by Zika virus infections, it can no longer be considered just a benign febrile infection. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
