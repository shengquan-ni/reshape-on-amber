Mod.TY, edited]<br><a href="http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/al-menos-26-millones-de-colombianos-riesgo-llegada-del-articulo-593132">http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/al-menos-26-millones-de-colombianos-riesgo-llegada-del-articulo-593132</a><br><br><br>At least 26 million Colombians at risk for the arrival of Zika virus<br>-------<br>The national government, headed by the Ministry of Health, confirmed this Thursday [15 Oct 2015] the 1st 9 cases in Colombia of Zika virus [infection], a disease that is transmitted by the same mosquito responsible for [transmission] of dengue and chikungunya [viruses].<br><br>According to the Vice Minister of Public Health and Social Services, Fernando Ruiz, they have confirmed these cases after the National Institute of Health (INS) did 98 tests [on samples from] Bolivar (13 from Cartagena and 85 from Turbaco). <br><br>"This is what happened with chikungunya; the Zika virus has come to stay in Colombia. This is a disease [virus] that was introduced from Easter Island and later into Brazil, as we came to know this past June [2015], when we stated that the arrival of this virus into the country [Colombia] was imminent," the official stated.<br><br>According to the Minister, Cartagena was the city into which the virus was imported, although the epidemiological connection connection is unknown, that is to say the identity of the person who brought in the virus. "This means that the infected foreign tourist transmitted the virus and initiated the chain of infections in the capital of Bolivar [Cartagena]," Ruiz explained, and stated that Zika [virus infection] produces symptoms in only 1 in 5 infected individuals, so it is possible that the tourist did not have any symptoms.<br><br>"The 26 million Colombians who live in municipalities under 2200 meters [700 ft] above sea level are susceptible to Zika [fever], but we have an advantage: the mosquito is less efficient when it comes to virus transmission, so [those who make] the epidemiological projections think that case [numbers] will not reach the 800 000 that we had with chikungunya," [he said]. <br><br>The Vice Minister specified that the disease [virus] is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which is also capable of transmitting dengue and chikungunya [viruses], so that he issued a call to intensify the daily control of mosquito breeding sites; eliminating them reduces the possibility of spread of the disease. "We request increasing the control measures, that is to say the clean water catchments, so as not to [avoid the breeding of] mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya or Zika. Fumigation is not effective because the mosquitoes remain within the houses. {Some] 5 days after fumigation, new mosquitoes reappear with the ability to resist the insecticide," Ruiz stated. <br><br>Meanwhile, The Director General of INS, Martha Lucia Ospina, explained the procedure for confirmation of the presence of the virus through respective field work, diagnosis in the respective reference laboratory, and sending samples for corresponding tests to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta (USA), to validate the tests done in the Colombia.<br><br>"The virus is expanding [geographically] in the Americas.  The migratory flow between Colombia and Brazil -- the 1st continental country with virus circulation -- is on the order of 14 000 people monthly," Ospina stated, stating that worldwide there have been large outbreaks, among which was one registered in French Polynesia of 29 000 cases without any deaths to date. However, some infected people present with neurological signs, such as polyneuritis, among others, in a few cases," he added.<br><br>In general, Zika virus disease has a benign progression.  Symptoms appear 3-12 days after the bite of the vector mosquito.  The course of the infection can be asymptomatic or moderate.  The symptoms of the disease are characterized by:<br>- Fever, but it may not be very high<br>- Red eyes without secretions and without itching.<br>- Rash with white or red spots<br>- Less common: muscular and joint pain.<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[The Ministry of Health in Colombia is to be commended for rapidly detecting and responding to the appearance of Zika virus in the country, and informing the public of its presence and means of transmission.  This transparency is essential for enlisting the participation of the public in vector control. <br><br>The Vice Minister is correct -- fumigation is of little long-term value as a vector control measure.  <br><br>It is not clear why the introduction of the virus into Cartegena is attributed to a foreign visitor from Easter Island or perhaps Brazil.  Introduction from Easter Island is very unlikely.  Cases there occurred in late September 2014, so arrival of a viremic individual from there would not have sparked this October 2015 outbreak in Colombia.  <br><br>However, there were cases reported in Vanuatu in late April 2015.  Zika virus has been spreading in Brazil since it was 1st detected there in May 2015, and has been reported from Mato Grosso, Alagoas, Parana, Ceara, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia Pernambuco, Roraima, Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Norte states.  Given the monthly flow of people between Brazil and Colombia, that means of introduction seems very likely, by either Brazilians or Colombians. <br><br>The statement that the vectors in Colombia are of low efficiency should be taken with caution. Vector efficiency of Zika virus in Colombia will not be known until the appropriate laboratory experiments are done using representative _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes taken from populations in the area, and more broadly where they occur in the country,<br><br>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Colombia can be accessed at <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16</a>. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
