Mod.TY, edited]<br><a href="http://beta.semana.com/nacion/articulo/virus-del-zika-van-239-casos-reportados-en-el-pais/448550-3">http://beta.semana.com/nacion/articulo/virus-del-zika-van-239-casos-reportados-en-el-pais/448550-3</a><br><br><br>"Zika virus is advancing more rapidly than we thought it would; we have 239 cases," said the Vice Minister of Health, Fernando Ruiz, who announced the number of reported cases when Semana spoke with him. He also explained what the plans are to combat it. <br><br>Since this past June [2015], the word "Zika" began to circulate among Colombians. It was a lesser [threat] because at that time it had reached [a total] of 16 cases reported in Brazil. Although at that time there were no reports of the arrival of the disease in Colombia, health authorities sounded the alarm.<br><br>Now, 4 months later, the panorama is different and worrisome. This same Vice Minister of Health, Fernando Ruiz, on Tuesday [3 Nov 2015] confirmed that there were 239 cases in Colombia. According to this high-ranking official, [the disease] occurred in Bolivar, Antioquia, San Andres, Norte de Santander and Sucre [departments].<br><br>[A Semana interview with Fernando Ruiz (FR) follows.]<br><br>Semana: Exactly how many Zika cases have occurred in the country?<br>FR: The numbers as of this Tuesday [3 Nov 2015] are 239 Zika cases. The progress of the virus is more rapid than we thought it would be. <br><br>Semana: Which departments are most affected?<br>FR: There are 103 [cases] in Bolivar, 37 in Antioquia, 37 in San Andres, 16 in Cucuta (Norte de Santander), 12 in Sincelejo (Sucre). But according to reports, the virus could arrive in 17 departments. Currently, we are studying possible cases in Cundinamarca, Caldas and Valle.<br><br>Semana: How many cases of [Zika virus] infected people do you expect in the country?<br><br>FR: At the present time, we are making the estimates. With chikungunya, we initially estimated [that there would be] 600 000 cases, but to date, there are 873 000 infected people, although only 450 000 reported and went to a doctor.<br><br>Semana: Could anyone die of [a] Zika [virus] infection?<br>FR: According to the WHO, there have been no reported Zika deaths in the world, but it could be that a person could have severe dengue as well as Zika [virus] and die of these 2 diseases. The only thing that is clear is that this virus [infection] is very mild. Only one of 5 affected people present with symptoms, and the other 4 could have it without knowing it.<br><br>The incubation period of the virus [infection] is 3-13 days. An infected person recuperates in 5 days, or at most 10. With chikungunya [virus], 2-3 percent of the cases have symptoms for more than 3 months. <br><br>Semana: What are the symptoms of Zika [virus infections]?<br>FR: People present with red eyes, skin rash, fever and general malaise, and may also present with joint pain. The key is reddening of the eyes that is not similar to conjunctivitis with secretions; they just become very red. Another key is skin rash; they are not hives but rather are red spots with a white center.<br><br>Semana: Are the health authorities prepared?<br>FR: Since the disease is new, we are training physicians to be able to know how to distinguish it. We have a video on our web page that provides a detailed explanation about the virus [infection]. <br><br>Semana: What are the recommendations for Colombians?<br>FR: The most important thing is prevention. We must fight the mosquito. This is not a mosquito that breeds in the forest; it breeds in fresh water catchments. That is why it is indispensable that people avoid having breeding places (such as flower vases and water tanks). The mosquito can reproduce in just 2-3 days [it takes twice that long or longer than that. - Mod.TY]. Another important point is that anyone at home who has a Zika [virus infection] should sleep under a bed net during the symptomatic period so that they are not bitten by the vector mosquito. The final message is that if there are zero breeding sites, then there are zero mosquitoes and zero dengue, chikungunya and Zika [virus infections].<br><br>Semana: How long will Zika persist in the country?<br>FR: Chikungunya has lasted a year, longer than in other places in the world. Zika could last for similar period of time or less, because its spread is happening a little more rapidly. <br><br>--<br>communicated by:<br>ProMED-ESP<br>&lt;promed@promedmail.org&gt;<br><br>[Zika virus infections are continuing to spread in Colombia. In a report published after the one above, 10 suspected cases of Zika virus infection occurred in Barranquilla, a city in Atlantico department. A 28 Oct 2015 ProMED-mail (ProMED-mail archive no.  <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open('../post/20151030.3756619');">20151030.3756619</a>) post indicated that the Colombian National Institute of Health confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the departments of Bolivar, Cordoba, Norte de Santander, San Andres and Sucre. The report above adds Antioquia to the list but does not mention Cordoba department. The Vice Minister is likely to be correct, and Zika virus will probably spread to 17 departments, all of which have _Aedes aegypti_ populations abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses. It will be interesting to see whether Zika virus spreads to the neighboring countries of Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama.<br><br>A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Colombia can be accessed at <a href="http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16">http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16</a>. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
