The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites.

Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.<br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html</a><br><br>[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]<br><br>- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because "the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower." The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, "We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro." There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.<br><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio">http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio</a><br><br>[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Declaring a PHEIC would be the kiss of death for Brazil's economy, killing the anticipated huge influx of foreign tourists for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and most foreign investment. - Mod.JW<br><br>It will be interesting to see if release of genetically modified mosquitoes that produce larvae that do not survive (see ProMED-mail archive no.  <a href="javascript:;" onclick="window.open('../post/20160128.3974426');">20160128.3974426</a>), that have reduced _Aedes aegypti_ populations in a pilot field trial in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state, will be extended to other localities, such as Rio de Janeiro in time for the Olympic Games in August. - Mod.TY]<br><br>- Microcephaly. 27 Jan 2016. New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.<br><a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html">http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html</a><br><br>[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. "Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat."<br><a href="http://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika">http://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika</a><br><br>A 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (&lt;steve@gideononline.com&gt;) states that "Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers." ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.<br><br>In a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.<br><br>There is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]<br><br>Colombia<br>- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the "extraordinary" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.<br><br>Zika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is "strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.<br><br>Vaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts "a straightforward developmental pathway" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. "I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents," says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.<br><br>Still, "there are many puzzles," says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of "cross protection," which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.<br><br>Approaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.<br><br>At the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. "Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites," Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.<br><br>NIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a "head start" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular "plasmid" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce "virus-like particles" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).<br><br>Inovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. "There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology," Kim concedes. "I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks."<br><br>The small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a "vector" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.<br><br>Predicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.<br><br>As a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. "This would take a little over a year," Kalil says. "That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic."<br><br>[Byline: Jon Cohen]<br><br>--<br>Communicated by:<br>ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall<br><br>[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]</p><p></p><h2>See Also</h2>
