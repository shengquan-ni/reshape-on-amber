## Comparison of potential JSON Schema form libraries

We chose [angular2-json-schema-form](https://github.com/dschnelldavis/angular2-json-schema-form) to generate the form based on the json Schema. Although it has many issues, it's a good choice in the current situation.

There are also many other libraries available. Here's the metrics to compare them:
  - if it's written for Angular 2+ (if it's not for Angular 2+, then if it's in pure Javascript, we want to avoid libraries for other frameworks, such as Angular 1 or React)
  - popularity, how many stars on github
  - maintenance and activeness, if the library author is actively maintaining it
  - user-friendliness and looks of the form it generated


Here is the comparison table:

| Library | Angular 2+ | Popularity | Maintenance | Look |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Our choice: [dschnelldavis/angular2-json-schema-form](https://github.com/dschnelldavis/angular2-json-schema-form) | Yes | 200+ | Very poor | Good |
| [makinacorpus/ngx-schema-form](https://github.com/makinacorpus/ngx-schema-form) | Yes | 200+ | Very poor | Bad |
| [json-schema-form/angular-schema-form](https://github.com/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form) | Angular 1 | 2000+ | Good. The author intended to make an [Angular 2+ version](https://github.com/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form/issues/774), but progress is very very slow | Good |
| [jdorn/json-editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) | JavaScript | 4000+ | Original author no longer maintains. Primary Fork by community: [json-editor/json-editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor) | Ok |
| [joshfire/jsonform](https://github.com/joshfire/jsonform) | JavaScript | 1000+ | Last updated 5 years ago | - |
| [gitana/alpaca](https://github.com/gitana/alpaca) | jQuer) | 900+ | not actively maintained: 300+ issues left open | Ok |


In conclusion, among all the potential libraries:
  - there's only 2 for Angular 2+, both are pooly maintained
  - most of them are not actively maintained (except the angular 1 library)

We chose the Angular 2 library because it's easy to integrate and the form it generates looks good.

However, the current library blocks our way of updating to Angular 6:
  - it relies on a beta version of `@angular/flex-layout`, updating it would break
  - no updates for Angular 6

If our current choice cannot satisfy our need or blocked our way of updating Angular,
 we are open to:
 1. switch to another library:
   - `makinacorpus/ngx-schema-form`: recently added a PR to support Angular 6
   - `json-schema-form/angular-schema-form`: spend time integrating Angular 1 library into our app
 2. make a fork (or use other people's fork) of the current library:
   - many people have forked the library to meet their need
